### Application Load Balancer

An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). ALB operates at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model and offers advanced routing and load balancing capabilities.

Two common deployment techniques used in software development and release management are canary deployment and blue-green deployment. By gradually implementing changes, they both seek to reduce the risk connected with releasing new versions of an application or service.

#### Canary Deployment:
Canary deployment involves releasing a new version of an application or service to a small subset of users or servers before making it available to the entire user base. The process is similar to how a canary in a coal mine was used to detect potential hazards. The idea is to test the new version in a controlled environment to identify any issues or performance problems before exposing it to a wider audience.
